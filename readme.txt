The provided code implements a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering and cosine similarity. It uses a movie dataset stored in a CSV file and recommends movies that are similar to a user-selected movie.

The code first loads the movie dataset into a pandas DataFrame and prepares the data by filling any missing values with empty strings. It then combines the relevant features of each movie, including keywords, cast, genres, and director, into a single string.

Next, it utilizes the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the combined features into a matrix of token counts. Using this count matrix, it calculates the cosine similarity between all pairs of movies.

To find similar movies, the user is prompted to enter the name of a movie. The code retrieves the index of the entered movie and computes the similarity scores between that movie and all others. It then sorts the similar movies based on their similarity scores in descending order.

Finally, the code prints the top 3 movies that are most similar to the user-selected movie.

This movie recommendation system is based on the concept of content-based filtering, which suggests movies with similar content to those liked by the user. It enables users to discover new movies that align with their preferences, making it a useful tool for personalized movie recommendations.

The code is well-structured, modular, and utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. It can be easily extended or customized to work with different datasets or incorporate additional features for improved recommendations.
